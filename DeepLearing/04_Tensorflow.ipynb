A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from **mobile devices** such as phones and tablets up to **large-scale distributed systems** of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as **GPU cards**. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including **training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models**, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including **speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery**. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an **open-source package** under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org*\n",
